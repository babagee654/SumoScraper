# SumoScraper

SumoScraper is my first Webscraper built using TypeScript and Playwright. It scrapes data of the latest Sumo Basho from https://sumodb.sumogames.de/Banzuke.aspx and organizes them into .txt files that I am planning to use for a separate project.

## Installation

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
npx playwright install-deps
npm run build
```

## Usage

Simply run the following script

```
npm start:prod
```

## Scraper Notes

-   Jan 2 2024, Hatsu Basho updated with latest banzuke, and Basho details
